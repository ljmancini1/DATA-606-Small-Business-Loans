### Background
<p>The State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) was created as part of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. The program appropriated $1.5 billion, distributed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, to provide direct support to states' programs designed to increase access to credit for small businesses. Funds were allocated to all fifty states along with the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the United States Virgin Islands. Funds were distributed according to a statutory formula that takes into account a state’s job losses in proportion to the aggregate job losses of all states. Under the Act, each state or territory was guaranteed a minimum allocation of 0.9 percent of the $1.5 billion.</p>

The SSBCI provides funding for two state program categories: Capital Access Programs (“CAPs”) and Other Credit Support Programs (“OCSPs”). 
  
<ul>
<li><b>CAPs</b> provide portfolio insurance for business loans based on a separate loan loss reserve fund for each participating financial institution. The reserve fund will be used to provide portfolio insurance for all loans enrolled in the CAP by participating financial institutions. To enroll a loan in the CAP, both the lender and the borrower of the loan make insurance premium payments to the reserve fund. The state also must make a payment to the reserve fund for each loan to match the insurance premium. Under the Act, states may use the federal funds allocated to them under the Act to make their matching contributions to the reserve fund. Under the Act, for a loan to be eligible for enrollment in the CAP, the borrower must have 500 employees (as defined in 13 C.F.R. Part 121.106) or less and the loan cannot exceed $5 million.</li>
<br>
<li><b>OCSPs</b> include collateral support programs, loan participation programs, state-sponsored venture capital programs, loan guarantee programs, or similar programs.Under the Act, OCSPs must target an average borrower or investee size of 500 employees (asdefined in 13 CFR Part 121.106) or less and cannot extend credit support to borrowers with more than 750 employees. The OCSP must target loans or investments with an average principal amount of $5 million or less and cannot provide credit or investment support if a giventransaction exceeds $20 million. For loan programs, the $20 million restriction applies to the principal amount of the loan directly supported by SSBCI, plus all other loans for the same loan purpose that close on or about the same date. For equity investment programs, the $20 million restriction applies to a single investment round that includes an SSBCI-funded investment, including all classes of equity instruments that close on or about the same date. OCSPs also include qualifying loan or swap funding facilities, which are contractual arrangements between a participating state and a private financial entity. Under such facilities, the state delivers funds to the private financial entity as collateral; that entity, in turn, provides funding to the state. The full amount resulting from the arrangement, less any fees or other costs of the arrangement, is contributed to, or for the account of, an approved state program.</li>
</ul>
